              Had a microneedling session at Age fix and
              I'm absolutely amazed by the results! The clinic has a welcoming and professional
               atmosphere, making me feel at ease right from the start. Gabi is truly an expert
               in her field, explaining each step of the process with great detail and care.
               The treatment was comfortable, and I was particularly impressed with the
               hygiene and safety measures in place. Just a few days post-treatment,
              my skin already feels rejuvenated, with a noticeable improvement."</p>

              I recently had the pleasure of experiencing a facial treatment at Age Fix and
              I must say, it was absolutely fantastic. From the moment I walked in,
              I was greeted by friendly staff and made to feel very welcome.
               The atmosphere was calming and the facility was clean and inviting.
               The aesthetician who performed my facial (Gabi)was knowledgeable and attentive.
               She took the time to assess my skin and discuss my concerns before customizing a t
              reatment plan for me. I felt like she genuinely cared"</p>
